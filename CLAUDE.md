# Claude Code Guidelines

## Development Workflow

1. **Before writing any code, describe your approach and wait for approval.** Always ask clarifying questions before writing any code if requirements are ambiguous.

2. **If a task requires changes to more than 3 files, stop and break it into smaller tasks first.**

3. **After writing code, list what could break and suggest tests to cover it.**

4. **When there's a bug, start by writing a test that reproduces it, then fix it until the test passes.**

5. **Every time the user corrects you, add a new rule to this CLAUDE.md file so it never happens again.**
