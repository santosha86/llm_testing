# PART I: INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITIONS

## Chapter 1: Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Background
The Electricity and Cogeneration Regulatory Authority (ECRA) hereby establishes this regulatory framework to govern the development, construction, operation, and decommissioning of renewable energy projects in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

### 1.2 Key Fact: Framework Effective Date
**IMPORTANT: This framework became effective on March 15, 2023, replacing all previous renewable energy guidelines.**

### 1.3 Applicability
This framework applies to:
- Solar photovoltaic (PV) projects exceeding 1 MW capacity
- Concentrated solar power (CSP) projects
- Wind energy projects
- Hybrid renewable energy systems
- Energy storage systems connected to renewable projects

### 1.4 Definitions

**"Authorized Capacity"** means the maximum generation capacity approved by ECRA for a specific project.

**"Capacity Factor"** means the ratio of actual energy output to theoretical maximum output over a given period.

**"Commercial Operation Date (COD)"** means the date on which a project begins delivering electricity to the grid under a power purchase agreement.
